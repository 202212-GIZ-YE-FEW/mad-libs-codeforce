Once upon a time, there was a boy named Alan[n] found a board game in his father's land and played[v] it with his girlfriend Sarah[n], but the game held him for more than twenty years in the bush until the number five or eight was thrown and Sarah fled. When two new visitors came to the abandoned[adj] house of Barish, two children with their aunt[obj], they found the game and strange events began to appear, but the youngest[adj] child rolled the dice and No. 5 appeared, which led to the liberation of now Barish from the bushes. They then end the game[o] with the help of Parrish and Sarah after they have embarked on unforgettable[adj] adventures from a herd of runaway animals to the famous hunter Van Belt. The story ends[v] when Parrish was now on the verge of death by gunshot, but the dice stopped[v] at number three and his character reached the center and so the game ended with the team's victory, so Barish and Sarah became children again and lived[v] their lives normally.
